# Advent of Code 2021 (Rust)
I was planning on doing some WebAssembly stuff but I will keep going with the makro I started last year.

### Bonus
Would have been cool if it was possible to just swap the solvers dynamically. WebAssembly modules for example?

## Setup
New puzzles can use the template of `bin/day0.rs` and change the solvers and test cases. Also `input/day%d_(input|test).txt` needs to be added with the input data provided by Advent of Code.

### Test
`cargo test --bin day0`

### Run
`cargo run --bin day0`


## Lessons Learned
